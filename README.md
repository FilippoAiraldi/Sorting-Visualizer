# Sorting Visualizer
This is my take on a sorting visualizing project. You can try out the application at https://filippoairaldi.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/ (I recommend the use of Firefox, there might be untested bugs on other browsers)! Feel free to add other sorting algorithms to the source code or modify it.
The project was heavily inspired by https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
